# PythonProject
Overview
This project implements various machine learning models to detect ransomware activity. The repository contains data processing notebooks, visualization tools, and implementations of multiple classification algorithms.


Implemented Models:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network)
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
XGboost
Naive Bayes

Data Processing Pipeline
The project includes three transformed versions of the dataset:
dataBinaire.csv - Binary transformed data
dataLogTransforme.csv - Log-transformed data
dataSansDoublons.csv - Cleaned data with duplicates removed
The processing workflow is documented in:
dataProcessing.ipynb (Data cleaning and transformation)
visualisation.ipynb (EDA and visualization)
